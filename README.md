# 🚀 University of Warp-Speed Learning

Welcome to my self-built university — a no-fluff, high-velocity, real-world, code-first learning system designed to outperform traditional CS degrees and build mastery in AI, MLOps, DevOps, Cloud, LLMs, and Fullstack Engineering with the help of AI.

## 🎯 Vision

> Learn **by building**, think **like an engineer**, grow **like a CTO**.

This project isn’t just about gaining knowledge — it's about **automating, scaling, and evolving** how we learn in the 21st century.
