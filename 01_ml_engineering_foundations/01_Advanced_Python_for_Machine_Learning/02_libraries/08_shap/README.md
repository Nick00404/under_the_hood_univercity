### **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**

#### **01_shap_intro.ipynb**

**Why it matters**:  
SHAP provides a unified framework to explain the output of machine learning models by assigning each feature a contribution to the prediction. This helps in understanding the decision-making process of the model, especially for black-box models like ensemble methods and deep learning.

**What you'll learn**:  
- How SHAP explains individual predictions and computes feature importance.
- Visualizing SHAP values for better interpretability.
- Understanding Shapley values, their foundation, and desirable properties.

1. **Introduction to SHAP**  
   - Model interpretability and why it's important for trust in machine learning models.
   - The concept of **Shapley values**, derived from game theory, which provides a fair distribution of contributions from features.
   - Differences between **model-agnostic** and **model-specific** explainers, and when to use each.

2. **Installing and Importing SHAP**  
   - Installing the SHAP package and importing the necessary core modules.
   - Compatibility with tree-based models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) and linear models.

3. **Shapley Values â€“ The Theory**  
   - The foundational game theory behind Shapley values.
   - How Shapley values ensure fair attribution of feature contributions to model predictions.
   - Key properties like **local accuracy** (accurately representing the model output) and **consistency** (predicting more important features with higher values).

4. **Basic Workflow with TreeExplainer**  
   - Fitting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest) and using SHAP to create explanations.
   - Using `TreeExplainer` for calculating SHAP values for datasets.

5. **Visualizing SHAP Values**  
   - Different plot types for visualizing SHAP values:
     - `summary_plot()` for an overview of feature importance.
     - `bar_plot()` and `beeswarm_plot()` for displaying feature importance.
     - `dependence_plot()` for understanding interactions between features.

6. **Understanding Feature Importance**  
   - How SHAP provides both **global interpretability** (overall feature importance) and **local interpretability** (individual predictions).
   - Comparing SHAP feature importance to other model-based feature importance metrics (e.g., `.feature_importances_`).

7. **Explaining Individual Predictions**  
   - Visualizing local explanations using `force_plot()` for individual predictions.
   - Creating **waterfall plots** to illustrate the flow of SHAP values for one prediction.
   - Providing a visual narrative for how individual features impact model decisions.
