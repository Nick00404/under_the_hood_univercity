#### **02_model_registry.ipynb**

**Why it matters**:  
MLflow's Model Registry helps manage the lifecycle of machine learning models, ensuring smooth transitions from development to production. It streamlines model deployment and version control, reducing errors in model management.

**What you'll learn**:  
- How to register, version, and deploy machine learning models.
- Managing models across stages (Staging, Production, Archived).
- Integrating model management into CI/CD pipelines.

1. **Introduction to Model Registry**
   - Key features and benefits of the MLflow Model Registry.

2. **Registering Models**
   - Model versioning and lifecycle management.
   - Registering models from training scripts.

3. **Managing Model Versions**
   - Transitioning models between stages (Staging, Production, Archived).
   - Retrieving and updating model versions.

4. **Model Deployment with MLflow**
   - Serving models for inference.
   - Deploying models to production.

5. **Collaborative Model Management**
   - Model approvals, reviews, and permissions.
   - Rollback strategies and version history management.

6. **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Automating model registry updates in CI/CD pipelines.
   - Integration with tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
