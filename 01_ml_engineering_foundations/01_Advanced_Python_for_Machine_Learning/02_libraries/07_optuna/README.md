### **Optuna: Hyperparameter Optimization Framework**

#### **01_optuna_basics.ipynb**

**Why it matters**:  
Optuna is a hyperparameter optimization framework designed for efficient search of hyperparameters in machine learning models. It helps automate the search for optimal hyperparameters, making model tuning easier and faster compared to traditional methods like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

**What you'll learn**:  
- Core concepts of Optuna (trials, studies, objective functions).
- How to define an objective function, track results, and visualize the optimization process.
- Saving, loading, and managing reproducibility during optimization.

1. **Introduction to Optuna**  
   - **What is Optuna?**: An open-source framework designed to automate hyperparameter optimization.
   - **Advantages**: Faster and more efficient than GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV; allows for adaptive optimization, automatic stopping of unpromising trials.
   - **Core Concepts**:
     - **Trial**: A single execution of the optimization process.
     - **Study**: A collection of trials aiming to optimize the objective function.
     - **Objective Function**: The function that evaluates the model's performance for different hyperparameters.

2. **Installation and Setup**  
   - Installing Optuna via `pip install optuna`.
   - Importing and setting up Optuna in your Python scripts.

3. **Defining the Objective Function**  
   - Structure of an **objective function** that takes a `trial` object and returns the evaluation metric.
   - Using `trial.suggest_*` methods for hyperparameter suggestions:
     - `trial.suggest_int()`, `trial.suggest_float()`, `trial.suggest_categorical()`, `trial.suggest_loguniform()`.

4. **Creating and Running a Study**  
   - **Creating a Study** with `optuna.create_study()`.
   - **Optimization Directions**: Choose between maximizing or minimizing the objective function.
   - **Running Optimization**: Using `study.optimize()` to start the search process.

5. **Tracking and Interpreting Results**  
   - **Best Trial**: Accessing the best trial, its parameters, and value.
   - **Intermediate Results**: Logging and printing results during optimization to monitor progress.

6. **Basic Visualizations**  
   - Visualizing the optimization history with `optuna.visualization.plot_optimization_history()`.
   - Understanding parameter importance with `plot_param_importances()`.
   - Visualizing search space and parameter relationships with `plot_slice()`.

7. **Reproducibility and Seeding**  
   - Ensuring reproducibility by setting random seeds.
   - Controlling randomness during trials and using reproducible samplers.

8. **Saving and Loading Studies**  
   - Storing studies in **storage backends** such as SQLite or in-memory.
   - Resuming optimization from a previous study or trial.

**Why it matters**:  
This section demonstrates how to integrate Optuna with real-world machine learning workflows, from model training to optimization pipelines. It also covers advanced topics like pruning unpromising trials and multi-metric optimization.

**What you'll learn**:  
- How to integrate Optuna with popular machine learning models.
- Advanced optimization techniques including pruning and multi-metric optimization.
- Best practices for optimizing hyperparameters efficiently and avoiding overfitting.

1. **Tuning Scikit-learn Models**  
   - **Integration with Scikit-learn** models like `RandomForestClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`.
   - Designing objective functions to optimize hyperparameters for `sklearn` models.
   - Handling train-test splits and cross-validation within the optimization process.

2. **Optuna with Pipelines**  
   - Passing **trial suggestions** into `sklearn.pipeline` components to optimize preprocessing and modeling steps.
   - Example of optimizing a pipeline with both preprocessor and classifier.

3. **Multi-metric Optimization (Optional Advanced)**  
   - Optimizing based on **multiple evaluation metrics** (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, etc.).
   - Creating custom composite metrics for multi-objective optimization.

4. **Using Callbacks**  
   - Implementing **early stopping** using callbacks to prevent unnecessary trials.
   - Logging and storing intermediate results during the optimization process.

5. **Pruning Unpromising Trials**  
   - **Pruning**: Stopping trials that are unlikely to perform well, saving time.
   - Using `optuna.integration` pruners, such as **MedianPruner**, within training loops to stop unpromising trials early.

6. **Visualizing Search Space Exploration**  
   - Visualizing the search path and progression of trials with:
     - `plot_contour()`: To visualize parameter space.
     - `plot_parallel_coordinate()`: To analyze interactions between hyperparameters.

7. **Best Practices for Optimization**  
   - Choosing appropriate **sampler strategies** (e.g., TPE, CMA-ES) for more efficient exploration.
   - Managing **computational costs** to avoid excessive resource usage during optimization.
   - **Avoiding overfitting** during hyperparameter tuning by using validation sets and robust cross-validation strategies.

8. **Saving and Reusing Best Model**  
   - **Exporting the best model** using `joblib` or `pickle` after optimization.
   - Retraining the best model on the entire dataset before deployment.
   - Considerations for **deployment** and handling hyperparameter tuning in production environments.
