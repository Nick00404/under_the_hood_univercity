# Git & CI/CD for Machine Learning Projects

## ðŸ“Œ What Youâ€™ll Learn

This module teaches you how to manage machine learning projects using Git, GitHub, and automation workflows. You'll gain hands-on skills in version control, advanced branching, collaborative workflows, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) tailored for data and ML teams.

Youâ€™ll also learn to integrate Git with ML tools like DVC, MLflow, and pre-commit systems â€” enabling full reproducibility and automation across your ML lifecycle.

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

Machine learning code is only one piece of the pipeline. To collaborate at scale, track experiments, handle large data, and deploy models reliably, teams need more than just notebooks â€” they need clean Git workflows and automated systems.

This module ensures your ML projects are:

- Reproducible and traceable  
- Collaborative and review-friendly  
- Automated, tested, and production-ready

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Inside

This learning path is structured into four progressive notebooks:

1. **Git Fundamentals** â€“ Core concepts and daily workflows  
2. **Advanced Git Workflows** â€“ Clean history, team collaboration, and large-scale Git  
3. **CI/CD for ML** â€“ Automating testing, validation, and deployment pipelines  
4. **Integrating with ML Tools** â€“ Connecting Git with DVC, MLflow, and environment management  

Each notebook builds on the last â€” combining software engineering best practices with ML-specific challenges.
