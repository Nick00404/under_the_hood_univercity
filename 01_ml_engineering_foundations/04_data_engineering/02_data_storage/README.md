### **Key Features**  
- **Pattern-First Approach**: Focuses on *when* and *why* to use storage systems, not just *how*.  
- **Cross-Module Links**: Schema evolution (07) ties to data quality (05_data_quality) and governance (06_data_governance).  
- **Real-World Labs**: Emphasizes measurable outcomes (cost reduction, query optimization).  
- **No Vendor Lock-In**: Principles apply across Iceberg/Delta, Snowflake/BigQuery, etc.
