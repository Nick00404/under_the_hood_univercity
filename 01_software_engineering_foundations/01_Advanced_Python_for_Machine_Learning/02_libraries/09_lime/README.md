### **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**

#### **01_lime_intro.ipynb**

**Why it matters**:  
LIME helps provide interpretability for machine learning models, which is essential for building trust and understanding how models make decisions. It is particularly valuable for complex black-box models like deep learning and ensemble methods.

**What you'll learn**:  
- How LIME provides local interpretability by approximating a black-box model with an interpretable model.
- How to use LIME with tabular and text data.
- Visualization techniques for better explanation understanding.

1. **Introduction to LIME**  
   - What LIME is and why it is useful for interpreting machine learning models.
   - The difference between local interpretability and global interpretability.
   - Comparison to other explanation techniques, like SHAP.

2. **Core Concepts of LIME**  
   - Understanding local surrogate models, perturbation sampling, and how they are used for model explanations.
   - Interpreting features in a transformed, interpretable space.

3. **Installing and Importing LIME**  
   - Installing the LIME package and importing necessary modules for both tabular and text data.

4. **Preparing Data for LIME**  
   - Preparing and preprocessing data (including handling categorical and numerical features) before applying LIME.
   - Training a model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Random Forest) for LIME to explain.

5. **Explaining Tabular Models**  
   - Using `LimeTabularExplainer` to explain a single prediction for a tabular model.
   - Understanding the structure of the explanation object produced by LIME.

6. **Visualizing LIME Results**  
   - Displaying LIME results in a user-friendly format using HTML and visualization techniques like bar plots.
   - Exporting explanations as images or text for sharing and documentation.
