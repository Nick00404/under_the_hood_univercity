**1. Data Product Design**  
1.1 Core Principles  
- Domain ownership and bounded contexts  
- Self-descriptive interfaces (schema, SLAs)  

1.2 Productization Patterns  
- APIs (REST/gRPC) vs. datasets (Iceberg/Delta)  
- Embedded quality metrics (freshness, accuracy)  

1.3 SLA Management  
- Automated monitoring (Monte Carlo, Prometheus)  
- Penalty frameworks for SLA breaches  

*Lab: Design a retail inventory data product with freshness SLAs.*

**2. Federated Compute & Governance**  
2.1 Distributed Query Patterns  
- Query federation (Trino, BigQuery Omni)  
- Cross-domain joins with privacy filters  

2.2 Policy Enforcement  
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) for attribute-based access  
- Centralized audit logging  

2.3 Cost Attribution  
- Chargeback/showback models  
- Resource tagging for cost allocation  

*Lab: Enforce GDPR-compliant access policies across domains using OPA.*
