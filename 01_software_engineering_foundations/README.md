## 📚 Sections Overview

### 📘 01. Advanced Python for Machine Learning
> Python mastery, from OOP to Recursion, and real-world libraries used in ML.

- Core Python, Modules, JSON, Recursion
- Numpy, Pandas, Polars
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- ML tooling: Scikit-Learn, Optuna, SHAP, LIME
- Deep Learning Foundations: PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAI
- Serving: Streamlit, Gradio
- Experiment Tracking: MLflow, DVC, Kedro, ZenML

📎 Each library has its own subfolder and README
