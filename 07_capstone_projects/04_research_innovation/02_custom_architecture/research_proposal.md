# ðŸ§ª Research Proposal â€“ Efficient Transformers for Edge-Scale NLP

## 1. ðŸ“Œ Title
**"Modular Transformer Architecture for Context-Adaptive, Low-Latency Language Modeling"**

---

## 2. ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To design, implement, and benchmark a novel transformer-based architecture capable of matching or exceeding current open-weight models in performance, while operating under tight memory and latency constraints suitable for edge devices, real-time systems, and rapid fine-tuning.

---

## 3. ðŸ”¬ Research Questions

- Can transformer depth be dynamically scaled per input to reduce compute without hurting accuracy?
- How does local vs global attention switching affect long-context reasoning?
- Can we deploy such a system using only open-source tools on consumer-grade GPUs?

---

## 4. ðŸ§  Proposed Architecture

- **Hybrid Attention Routing**: Learned switches route attention through local or global mechanisms depending on token entropy.
- **Adaptive Depth Scaling**: Tokens dynamically select how many layers to traverse.
- **Modular Transformer Blocks**: Designed to support quantization, LoRA, and ONNX export.
- **Colab-friendly Footprint**: Trainable and testable on a single A100 or T4.
