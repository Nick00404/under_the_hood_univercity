## 🔄 **Capstone: Model Drifts & Retraining Pipeline**

---

### 📉 **01. Data Drift Detection**

#### 📌 **Subtopics Covered:**
- Types of drift: **covariate, prior, concept**
- Statistical methods: **KS test, PSI (Population Stability Index)**
- Visualizing drift using histograms, distributions
- Integrating drift checks into preprocessing pipelines

---

### 📦 **02. Model Drift Detection**

#### 📌 **Subtopics Covered:**
- Monitoring **prediction distribution shift**  
- **Accuracy drop vs uncertainty rise**  
- Tracking **confidence decay** over time  
- Tools: Evidently, Fiddler, WhyLabs, custom logging

---

### 🔁 **03. Retraining Pipeline (CI/CD for Models)**

#### 📌 **Subtopics Covered:**
- Setting up **auto-triggered training jobs**  
- Using pipelines (Airflow/Kubeflow) for data → train → evaluate → deploy  
- Model registry integration: tagging, versioning  
- Rollback strategy if retraining underperforms

---

### 🛎️ **04. Monitoring & Alerting**

#### 📌 **Subtopics Covered:**
- Real-time alerts: **Slack, Prometheus + Grafana, Azure Monitor**  
- Triggering actions based on drift thresholds  
- Logging and dashboards for pipeline status  
- Alert tuning to avoid false positives

---

### 🧪 **05. Batch Retraining**

#### 📌 **Subtopics Covered:**
- Periodic retraining strategy (e.g. daily, weekly)  
- Use cases: stable data pipelines, large datasets  
- Offline evaluation before promoting to production  
- Resource planning and scheduling

---

### ⚡ **06. Online (Incremental) Retraining**

#### 📌 **Subtopics Covered:**
- Updating models with **streaming or mini-batch data**  
- Algorithms that support incremental learning  
- Real-time evaluation with moving averages  
- Trade-offs: performance, memory, stability
