# 🛡️ Patent Disclosure – Custom Transformer Architecture

## 1. 📄 Title of Invention
**"Context-Aware Efficient Transformer with Hybrid Attention Routing and Adaptive Depth Scaling"**

---

## 2. 🔍 Abstract

This invention proposes a novel transformer-based architecture optimized for resource-efficient inference and dynamic contextual reasoning. It integrates hybrid attention routing (local-global-switching mechanism) with adaptive depth scaling based on input complexity. This allows the model to dynamically adjust computation depth and memory usage per token sequence, offering significant advantages for low-latency, on-device NLP tasks.

## 3. ⚙️ Technical Field

The invention pertains to the field of deep learning and natural language processing, specifically neural network architectures for efficient sequence modeling and transformer-based language models.

---

## 4. 🚀 Background

Current transformer architectures exhibit high computational cost due to full-depth computation and uniform attention for all input tokens. While models like GPT-3 or Mistral deliver strong results, they do so at the cost of inference speed and energy usage.

There remains a need for a transformer that:
- Dynamically adjusts its depth and routing per token
- Balances local and global attention on demand
- Maintains high performance with reduced compute

## 5. 🧠 Summary of Invention

The proposed architecture introduces:

1. **Hybrid Attention Routing**  
   - Tokens dynamically choose between local-window attention or full-sequence global attention based on learned importance scores.
   - Reduces memory footprint and FLOPs for low-context regions.

2. **Adaptive Depth Scaling**  
   - Blocks are conditionally activated or skipped based on input token entropy.
   - Uses gating mechanisms similar to early exit transformers but learned during training.

3. **Modular Plug-In Compatibility**  
   - Architecture supports quantization, LoRA fine-tuning, and ONNX export without modification.

4. **Use Case Optimization**  
   - Real-time summarization, chat agents, and code completion on constrained hardware.
