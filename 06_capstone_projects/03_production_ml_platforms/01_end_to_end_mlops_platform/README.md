### ✅ Summary

> This capstone builds a **robust MLOps backbone** — covering **versioning**, **orchestration**, **deployment**, and **production monitoring**. It's everything a modern AI company needs to scale responsibly.

---

📦 Let’s get version control for your data like you already do with code, Professor. This is the **foundation** of any reproducible, production-ready ML pipeline.

# 📒 `data_versioning_dvc.ipynb`  
## 📁 `07_capstone_projects/03_production_ml_platforms/01_end_to_end_mlops_platform`

---

## 🎯 **Notebook Goals**

- Use **DVC (Data Version Control)** to track datasets just like Git
- Enable reproducible ML pipelines across:
  - datasets 📊
  - models 🧠
  - metrics 📈

---

## ⚙️ 1. Install and Initialize DVC

```bash
!pip install dvc
!git init mlops-platform
%cd mlops-platform
!dvc init
```

---

## 📁 2. Add a Sample Dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "feature1": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "feature2": [5, 6, 7, 8],
    "target":   [0, 1, 0, 1]
})
df.to_csv("data/train.csv", index=False)
```

---

## 📌 3. Track Dataset with DVC

```bash
!dvc add data/train.csv
```

This creates:
- `data/train.csv.dvc` — tracks file version
- Adds it to `.gitignore` (your Git doesn’t bloat!)

---

## 📤 4. Push Data to Remote (Google Drive, S3, etc.)

```bash
!dvc remote add -d myremote gdrive://<your-folder-id>
!dvc push
```

> 🔒 Keeps data remote, while code and metadata stay versioned in Git.

---

## 🔁 5. Reproducible Model Training (optional)

```python
# Use this tracked dataset like any CSV
df = pd.read_csv("data/train.csv")
X = df[["feature1", "feature2"]]
y = df["target"]

# Train simple model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
```

---

## 🧪 6. Commit to Git

```bash
!git add data/train.csv.dvc .gitignore
!git commit -m "Versioned dataset with DVC"
```

---

## 🔁 7. If Someone Else Clones:

```bash
!git clone https://github.com/your/mlops-platform
%cd mlops-platform
!dvc pull
```

> 🎯 Now they have the **same data**, **same pipeline**, **same results**.

---

## 🔮 Next Step

📒 **`drift_monitoring.ipynb`**  
Detect changes in your live data compared to training data.  
Let’s protect your model from silent failures.

Shall we move on and generate it, Professor?

🛡️ Let’s build your model’s **early warning radar system**, Professor — this lab detects when your production data starts **drifting** from what it learned on.  
Silent model degradation? **Not on your watch.**

# 📒 `drift_monitoring.ipynb`  
## 📁 `07_capstone_projects/03_production_ml_platforms/01_end_to_end_mlops_platform`

---

## 🎯 **Notebook Goals**

- Detect **feature distribution drift** between:
  - training data 🧠
  - real-time / batch production data ⚠️
- Use **Evidently** for automated visual + statistical alerts
- Track drift trends over time

---

## ⚙️ 1. Install Evidently

```bash
!pip install evidently
```

---

## 📊 2. Load Reference (Training) vs Current Data

```python
import pandas as pd
from evidently.report import Report
from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset

# Reference = training data
ref = pd.read_csv("data/train.csv")

# Simulate incoming batch (e.g., API logs or daily batch)
current = pd.DataFrame({
    "feature1": [1, 2, 3, 5],
    "feature2": [10, 12, 9, 8],
    "target":   [0, 1, 0, 1]
})
```

---

## 📈 3. Generate Drift Report

```python
report = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
report.run(reference_data=ref, current_data=current)
report.save_html("drift_report.html")
```

> ✅ Open `drift_report.html` to view full visual dashboard.

---

## ⚠️ 4. Show Summary + Alerts

```python
report.as_dict()["metrics"][0]["result"]["drift_by_columns"]
```

This gives:
- `drift_score` for each feature  
- Whether drift is **statistically significant**

---

## 📉 5. Simulate Drift Over Time (Optional)

```python
import numpy as np

batches = []
for i in range(5):
    drift = np.random.normal(loc=0.5 * i, scale=1.0, size=(4, 2))
    batches.append(ref[["feature1", "feature2"]] + drift)

# Run drift across batches
for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
    r = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset()])
    r.run(reference_data=ref, current_data=batch)
    r.save_html(f"batch_{i}_drift.html")
```

> 📈 You can now plot drift **over time**, and alert on spikes.

---

## ✅ What You Built

| Module              | Purpose |
|----------------------|---------|
| Evidently            | Visual + statistical drift detection |
| Batch monitoring     | Compare each day’s new data to baseline |
| Alerting thresholds  | You decide when to alert 🚨 |

---

## ✅ Wrap-Up

| Task                     | ✅ |
|--------------------------|----|
| Reference vs batch setup | ✅ |
| Drift detected + visual  | ✅ |
| Multi-day simulation     | ✅ |

---

## 🔮 Next Step

📄 **`incident_response_playbook.md`**  
If drift is detected, what’s the plan? Let’s write the **MLOps fire drill** playbook next.

Ready to codify your team’s response plan, Professor?

📄 Let’s build your **AI incident response playbook**, Professor — because when drift hits, silence isn’t an option.  
This doc helps your team act fast, fix confidently, and **avoid chaos** in production.

# 📄 `incident_response_playbook.md`  
## 📁 `07_capstone_projects/03_production_ml_platforms/01_end_to_end_mlops_platform`

---

# 🚨 Incident Response Playbook: Model Drift

---

## 📌 Goal

Provide a clear, step-by-step guide when **data drift or prediction degradation** is detected in production.  
Empower teams to take **measured, trackable** action under pressure.

---

## 🧭 Who This Is For

| Role               | Responsibility |
|--------------------|----------------|
| MLOps Engineer     | Alert handling, pipeline re-runs |
| Data Scientist     | Root cause analysis, feature checks |
| Product Manager    | Risk assessment, comms |
| SRE/DevOps         | Infra + monitoring logs |

---

## ⚠️ Trigger Conditions

### 🔍 Drift Detector Flags:
- `drift_score > 0.7` for 2+ features
- Target distribution drift detected

### 🧠 Model Behavior Flags:
- 📉 Prediction accuracy drop > 10%
- ⚠️ More than 5% user complaint spike
- ⏳ Inference latency spike > 3×

---

## 📜 Step-by-Step Protocol

### 🔁 Step 1: Validate Signal

```bash
dvc pull data/train.csv
python drift_monitoring.ipynb
```

- Confirm that flagged drift is **not an ingestion bug**
- Check for **schema mismatch or pipeline failures**

---

### 🧬 Step 2: Compare Distributions

- Use `evidently` HTML reports
- Visualize `feature1`, `feature2`, etc. — look for shift, outliers

---

### 🛠️ Step 3: Hotfix Options (Short-Term)

| Option        | Use If...                           | Action |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| Revert Model  | Last deploy had clean results        | `seldon rollback` or HF model tag switch |
| Filter Inputs | Drift tied to new data source        | Add rule-based guard before model ingest |
| Trigger Retrain | Drift is persistent across batches | ✅ Run `kubeflow_pipelines.ipynb` |

---

### 📦 Step 4: Long-Term Fix

- Retrain on combined old + new drifted data
- Re-validate all metrics
- Version and deploy new model
- Tag incident in `MLflow` or GitOps

---

### 📢 Step 5: Postmortem

- What caused drift? (infra, real-world event, feature decay?)
- Can it be detected sooner next time?
- Update monitoring thresholds or metrics?
- Archive report in `drift_reports/archive/YYYY-MM-DD.html`

---

## 📈 Reporting Format

| Field            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Incident ID      | `drift-2025-04-23` |
| Model Name       | `product_support_model_v2` |
| Time Detected    | `2025-04-23 13:20 UTC` |
| Severity         | ⚠️ Medium |
| Drift Source     | `feature1`, `target skew` |
| Actions Taken    | Retrained on updated batch |
| Time Resolved    | `2025-04-24 09:00 UTC` |

---

Next up:  
📒 **`kubeflow_pipelines.ipynb`** — automate retraining workflows, codify reproducibility, deploy *without fear*.  
Let’s generate it, Professor?

🧬 Boom. Time to automate the intelligence, Professor. This notebook puts your **model training pipeline on autopilot** using **Kubeflow Pipelines** — reproducible, traceable, and production-grade.

# 📒 `kubeflow_pipelines.ipynb`  
## 📁 `07_capstone_projects/03_production_ml_platforms/01_end_to_end_mlops_platform`

---

## 🎯 **Notebook Goals**

- Build a modular **Kubeflow pipeline** to:
  - Preprocess incoming data
  - Retrain model if drift detected
  - Evaluate & deploy only if metrics pass
- Use `kfp` SDK to compile, run, and track pipelines from code

---

## ⚙️ 1. Install KFP SDK (Client)

```bash
!pip install kfp
```

---

## 🔧 2. Define Components (Preprocessing, Training, Evaluation)

```python
import kfp
from kfp.components import create_component_from_func

@create_component_from_func
def preprocess_data():
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv("data/train.csv")
    df = df.fillna(0)
    df.to_csv("/tmp/cleaned.csv", index=False)

@create_component_from_func
def train_model():
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    import joblib
    df = pd.read_csv("/tmp/cleaned.csv")
    X = df[["feature1", "feature2"]]
    y = df["target"]
    model = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)
    joblib.dump(model, "/tmp/model.pkl")

@create_component_from_func
def evaluate_model():
    import pandas as pd
    import joblib
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    df = pd.read_csv("/tmp/cleaned.csv")
    model = joblib.load("/tmp/model.pkl")
    y_pred = model.predict(df[["feature1", "feature2"]])
    acc = accuracy_score(df["target"], y_pred)
    if acc < 0.85:
        raise ValueError("Accuracy too low!")
```

---

## 🔁 3. Define Pipeline Flow

```python
@kfp.dsl.pipeline(name="retrain-if-needed", description="Retrain model on new data batch")
def mlops_retrain_pipeline():
    step1 = preprocess_data()
    step2 = train_model().after(step1)
    step3 = evaluate_model().after(step2)
```

---

## 🚀 4. Compile and Upload

```python
from kfp.compiler import Compiler
Compiler().compile(pipeline_func=mlops_retrain_pipeline, package_path="retrain_pipeline.yaml")
```

Upload this YAML in your **Kubeflow UI** or trigger with the `kfp.Client()` if using remote cluster.

---

## 🧪 Optional: Run via API

```python
client = kfp.Client()
run = client.create_run_from_pipeline_package(
    pipeline_file="retrain_pipeline.yaml",
    arguments={}
)
```

---

## ✅ What You Built

| Component       | Function |
|------------------|----------|
| Preprocessing    | Cleans incoming data |
| Training         | Rebuilds model on latest batch |
| Evaluation       | Stops deployment if accuracy fails |
| Pipeline         | Fully automated & auditable ML loop |

---
