# Problem Statement: **[Competition Name or Problem Statement]**

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this competition is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting **[target variable]** based on the provided dataset. The model will be evaluated on its ability to **[predict target variable]** with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, or other evaluation metric as specified.

The challenge is to optimize a model that can handle **[data-related challenges like missing values, imbalance, large-scale datasets, etc.]**, while ensuring that it generalizes well to unseen data.

## üß† Problem Description
The dataset consists of **[number]** records with **[features]** and a target variable **[target name]**. The features include both **numerical** and **categorical** data, with some of the common challenges like missing values, outliers, and high cardinality in categorical features. The task is to build a model that can predict the target variable based on the inputs.

### Target Variable
The target variable is **[name]**, and it can be a **[classification/regression]** task:
- **Classification**: A binary or multi-class target where the goal is to classify each row into a category.
- **Regression**: A continuous variable that the model will try to predict.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Dataset Details
The competition dataset is composed of the following:

- **Train Data**: `train.csv`
  - **[Feature 1]**: Description of feature 1
  - **[Feature 2]**: Description of feature 2
  - **[Feature 3]**: Description of feature 3

- **Test Data**: `test.csv`
  - The test data has similar features to the train data, excluding the target variable. It will be used to evaluate model predictions.

- **Sample Submission**: `sample_submission.csv`
  - This file contains the format for your submission. It should be in the form of a CSV with **[target variable]** predictions for each row in the test set.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing will include the following steps:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (if necessary)
- Feature scaling or normalization
- Handling imbalanced data through sampling techniques or model adjustments
- Feature engineering based on domain knowledge (if applicable)

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics
The model will be evaluated using the **[evaluation metric]**:
- **Accuracy**: Measures how many predictions were correct.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, especially for imbalanced classes.
- **AUC-ROC**: Useful for binary classification tasks.

The final score is calculated using the test data predictions, which will be submitted via **[submission format]**.

## üí° Next Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
2. **Model Development**: Train multiple machine learning models and tune hyperparameters.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models on validation data and select the best model for submission.
