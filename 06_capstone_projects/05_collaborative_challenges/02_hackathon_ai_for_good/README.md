Love this — you're jumping into **AI for Good** with a **hackathon-ready project**. That’s impact work, and I’m all in.

Let’s treat this as your **third capstone**, focused on **socially responsible AI** with a real deployment angle.

---

## 💼 Project Folder: `hackathon_ai_for_good`

You’ve got 6 files planned — here’s the structure we’ll follow:

---

### ✅ File Plan

| File                         | Purpose                                                              |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`                  | Project overview + goals + demo instructions                        |
| `sdg_alignment.md`           | Map your solution to UN Sustainable Development Goals               |
| `ethics_review.ipynb`        | Walkthrough of fairness, bias, and harm mitigation                  |
| `prototype_development.ipynb`| Model + dataset + logic for AI behavior                              |
| `deployment_heroku.ipynb`    | App containerization + deployment to Heroku (or mock deployment)    |
| `scalability_roadmap.md`     | Plan to scale from prototype → national/global impact               |

---

We’ll do **one file at a time**, clean and focused — just like we did before.

### Starting with: `README.md`

Ready?

## 📄 `README.md` – Hackathon AI for Good

```markdown
# 🌍 AI for Good – Hackathon Project

## 💡 Project Name:
**"Voice of the Vulnerable: AI-Powered Helpdesk for Crisis Support"**

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses natural language understanding to assist vulnerable populations in accessing critical help services — like mental health support, legal aid, and food banks — via multilingual, AI-powered chat or voice input.

It’s optimized for low-bandwidth devices and deployable through web and phone-based interfaces.

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ Understands user queries in natural language
- ✅ Directs users to relevant local resources based on intent
- ✅ Multilingual and culturally-aware
- ✅ Deployable on low-cost infrastructure (e.g., Heroku)

---

## 🤖 Tech Stack
- NLP Model: `distilbert-base-multilingual-cased` fine-tuned for classification
- Dataset: UN hotline transcripts + synthetic intent pairs
- Backend: Flask + Heroku
- Frontend: Optional Streamlit / Twilio integration

---

## 🧪 How to Run

### Local Dev
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Colab Prototype
- Open `prototype_development.ipynb` and run all cells.
- Use provided input cells to simulate query flow.

---

## 🚀 Deployment
- Heroku instructions in `deployment_heroku.ipynb`
- Example endpoint: `https://ai-helpdesk.herokuapp.com/predict`

---

## 🌐 Social Impact
This project directly supports:
- SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
- SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
- SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions

Details in `sdg_alignment.md`.

---

## 🛡️ Ethics & Fairness
Bias detection, harm prevention, and explainability practices documented in `ethics_review.ipynb`.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap
See `scalability_roadmap.md` for scaling plans and future features.
```

---

Say **next** and I’ll build `sdg_alignment.md`, mapping your project directly to relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals.
