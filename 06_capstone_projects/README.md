# 🚀 Capstone Projects at Under The Hood University (UTHU)

Welcome to the **Capstone Arena** — where all your foundational knowledge gets applied to solve real-world, high-impact challenges.  
Each capstone project is **hands-on**, **GPU/Colab-ready**, and built to simulate problems from production ML systems, research labs, or startup-grade product pipelines.

## 🧠 How to Use

1. **Start anywhere** based on your interest or domain.
2. Every folder has:
   - 📘 `README.md`: Purpose + architecture + tech stack
   - 🧪 `.ipynb` notebooks: Modular, lab-style tasks
   - 🛠️ Configs & scripts (when needed)
3. **Run in Colab or VSCode** with GPU support if possible.

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Make sure you’ve completed:

- ✅ `03_ml_basics/`
- ✅ `04_deep_learning/`
- ✅ `06_mlops/` (recommended for deployment & CI/CD flows)

---

## 🏁 Final Goal

By the end of these projects, you should be able to:

- Architect end-to-end ML systems
- Prototype & deploy open-source LLMs
- Contribute to research-grade work
- Build and ship ML products like a startup engineer
