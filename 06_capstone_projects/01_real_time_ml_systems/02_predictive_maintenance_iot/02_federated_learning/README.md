## 🧠 **What Is Federated Learning?**

> Federated Learning (FL) allows you to train models **without moving data**—instead, the model moves to the data. It’s like sending the brain to learn at each house rather than collecting everyone’s books.

It’s a game changer for:

- 🔐 **Privacy** (e.g., healthcare, finance, mobile apps)
- 🌐 **Edge AI** (e.g., predictive maintenance, smart cities)
- ⚡ **Low-bandwidth settings** (e.g., IoT networks)

- **Communication-efficient**: Each client only shared weights, never data.
- **No Privacy Compromise**: Simulated clients retained full data control.

|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Uneven data distributions     | Try FedProx or sample re-weighting  |
| Client dropout / failure      | Retry mechanisms, async FL methods  |
| Accuracy plateauing early     | Increase local epochs or round count|

---

## 🛠 Future Experiments

- Test on real-world vibration/telemetry sensor data.
- Add **differential privacy** noise to model updates.
- Implement **asynchronous FL** with client staleness tolerance.
- Add federated model evaluation hooks with logging (e.g., MLflow).
