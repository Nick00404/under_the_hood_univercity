## ðŸ“š Statistics and Probability

1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
   - Measures of dispersion: variance, standard deviation, interquartile range
   - Data visualization: histograms, box plots, scatter plots

2. **Probability Basics**
   - Probability theory fundamentals: outcomes, events, sample space
   - Conditional probability and independence
   - The Law of Total Probability and the Bayes Rule

3. **Distributions**
   - Discrete distributions: Binomial, Poisson
   - Continuous distributions: Normal, Uniform, Exponential
   - Properties of distributions: mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis

4. **Bayes Theorem**
   - Understanding Bayes' Theorem
   - Prior, likelihood, posterior, and evidence
   - Applications of Bayes' theorem in classification and updating beliefs

5. **Statistical Tests**
   - Hypothesis testing: null and alternative hypotheses
   - p-values, significance levels, and Type I/Type II errors
   - Common tests: t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA

6. **Sampling and Bootstrapping**
   - Sampling methods: random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling
   - Central Limit Theorem and its implications
   - Bootstrapping for estimation of statistics and model validation
