### **1. Data Drift Detection with Evidently**

**1.1 Core Concepts of Data Drift**  
- Identifying shifts in input feature distributions  
- Statistical methods for drift detection (e.g., KL divergence, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)  

**1.2 Evidently Overview**  
- Setting up Evidently for monitoring model inputs and outputs  
- Customizing drift detection reports and visualizations  

**1.3 Monitoring Drift at Scale**  
- Handling large-scale feature monitoring (batch vs. streaming)  
- Integrating with data lakes or warehouses (e.g., S3, BigQuery)  

*Lab: Set up Evidently to monitor data drift for a classification model over time.*

### **3. Performance Tracking with Prometheus & Grafana**

**3.1 Prometheus for Metrics Collection**  
- Exposing custom model metrics via Prometheus client library  
- Defining key performance indicators (KPIs): latency, throughput, success rate  

**3.2 Grafana Dashboards for Visualization**  
- Designing custom dashboards to track model performance metrics  
- Real-time monitoring and alerting in Grafana based on Prometheus data  

**3.3 Scaling and Alerting Mechanisms**  
- Defining alert thresholds and anomaly detection  
- Integrating Slack or email notifications for performance anomalies  

*Lab: Set up Prometheus to monitor model latency and throughput, and visualize it in Grafana.*

### **4. Model Performance Dashboards**

**4.1 Key Performance Metrics**  
- Accuracy, F1 score, precision/recall, and business-specific metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction score)  
- Tracking model outputs over time to identify performance degradation  

**4.2 Interactive Dashboards**  
- Using Dash or Streamlit to build interactive visualizations  
- Displaying performance metrics and drift indicators in real-time  

**4.3 Performance Benchmarks**  
- Comparing model versions (e.g., comparing A/B test results)  
- Historical performance and trend analysis  

*Lab: Build an interactive dashboard to track the F1 score and data drift of your deployed model.*

### **5. Alerting & Integration with Slack**

**5.1 Defining Alert Rules**  
- Alerting thresholds based on key metrics (e.g., 10% drop in accuracy, increased latency)  
- Setting up anomaly detection algorithms for automatic alerts  

**5.2 Integrating Alerts with Slack**  
- Configuring Slack Webhooks for automated notifications  
- Building rich message formatting with alert details and links  

**5.3 Post-Alert Actions**  
- Triggering automated re-training workflows from alerts  
- Integrating with incident management tools (e.g., PagerDuty)  

*Lab: Set up an alerting system in Slack that triggers when model accuracy falls below a predefined threshold.*

### ✳️ **Pedagogical Goals Across the Module**

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Emphasize the importance of continuously monitoring models for performance issues and data shifts.  
- **Data and Concept Drift**: Teach students to differentiate and handle both types of drift in real-time systems.  
- **Automation & Integration**: Ensure that students can integrate monitoring tools with CI/CD pipelines and alerting systems for end-to-end automation.
