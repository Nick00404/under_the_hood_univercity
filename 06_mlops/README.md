# ðŸ“¦ 06_mlops

## Overview
îˆƒThe **06_mlops** module is a deep dive into the practices and tools that bridge the gap between machine learning development and production deployment. MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) ensures that ML models are robust, scalable, and maintainable in real-world applicationsîˆ„îˆ†
îˆƒThis module is structured to provide both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, encompassing the entire ML lifecycle from model development to monitoring in production environmentsîˆ„îˆ†
