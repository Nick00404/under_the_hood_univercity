## ✅ **04_deployment_strategies**

This module covers strategies for deploying machine learning models into scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure environments. It includes containerization, orchestration with Kubernetes, deployment on serverless infrastructures, and advanced deployment strategies such as blue/green and canary releases.

### **1. Docker Image Creation for ML Models**

**1.1 Containerization Principles**  
- Writing efficient `Dockerfile` for ML models  
- Multi-stage builds for lean, secure images  

**1.2 Managing Dependencies**  
- Managing Python packages with `requirements.txt`, `Pipenv`, `Conda`  
- Handling OS-level dependencies (e.g., `libtensorflow`, `libcuda`)  

**1.3 Versioning and Model Artifacting**  
- Embedding model weights and configurations into images  
- Image tagging strategies for version control  

*Lab: Build and optimize a Docker image for serving a TensorFlow model with dependencies.*

### **2. Kubernetes Deployment with Helm & Kustomize**

**2.1 Kubernetes Core Concepts**  
- Pods, Deployments, and ReplicaSets  
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for efficient resource allocation  

**2.2 Helm Charts for ML Models**  
- Using `helm` to package, configure, and deploy ML models  
- Customizing charts for specific model environments (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)  

**2.3 Kustomize for Dynamic Deployment Configuration**  
- Layering Kubernetes YAMLs with Kustomize for different environments  
- Parametrizing deployments with overlays  

*Lab: Deploy an ML model to Kubernetes using Helm charts, and customize it with Kustomize.*

### **3. Model Deployment with Seldon & KServe**

**3.1 Introduction to Seldon & KServe**  
- Seldon’s ML deployment architecture and integration with Kubernetes  
- KServe’s inference service framework for model deployment  

**3.2 Model Serving with Explainability**  
- Integrating explainers (SHAP, LIME) with Seldon or KServe  
- Real-time model explainability through REST/gRPC endpoints  

**3.3 Multi-Model Deployment**  
- Managing model versions and performing rolling upgrades  
- A/B testing and performance tracking with Seldon/KServe  

*Lab: Deploy a Scikit-learn model with explainability integrated using Seldon/KServe.*

### **4. Serverless Deployment to Cloud Run & Lambda**

**4.1 Serverless Frameworks Overview**  
- Cloud Run for fully managed containerized applications  
- AWS Lambda for event-driven model inference  

**4.2 Deploying Containers to Cloud Run**  
- Packaging ML models as Docker containers for Cloud Run  
- Scaling policies and auto-scaling inference requests  

**4.3 Deploying Functions to AWS Lambda**  
- Using Lambda’s limited runtime for lightweight inferences  
- Packaging models and dependencies for Lambda (e.g., AWS Lambda Layers)  

*Lab: Deploy a FastAPI-based model on Cloud Run and a lightweight model in AWS Lambda.*

### **5. Advanced Deployment Patterns (Blue-Green, Canary, Shadow)**

**5.1 Blue/Green Deployment**  
- Zero-downtime updates with production rollbacks  
- Automating traffic routing between blue/green environments  

**5.2 Canary Releases**  
- Gradual rollout with feedback loops  
- Implementing A/B testing in production environments  

**5.3 Shadow Deployment**  
- Routing live traffic to new models for benchmarking without affecting production  
- Anomaly detection during shadowing for safe model rollouts  

*Lab: Implement a blue/green deployment strategy for model updates on Kubernetes.*

### ✳️ **Pedagogical Goals Across the Module**

- **Infrastructure Flexibility**: Teach how to deploy on diverse infrastructures — cloud, serverless, or on-prem.  
- **Robust Release Strategies**: Ensure safe rollouts with real-time feedback and progressive deployment.  
- **Decoupling Inference from Deployment**: Address the independence of deployment pipelines from model training pipelines, ensuring smooth model updates.
