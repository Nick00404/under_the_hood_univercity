        "\n",
        "### Definition:\n",
        "- **Variables** 🏷️: In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a memory location where data can be stored and modified. Variables are used to store values like numbers, text, lists, and more. They can change their value during the execution of a program.\n",
        "- **Constants** 🔑: Unlike variables, constants are values that do not change once assigned. While Python does not have a built-in constant type, the convention is to write constant names in uppercase to indicate that their values should remain unchanged throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",
        "- **Variable Assignment** 📦: Variables are created by assigning a value to a name using the `=` operator.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    x = 5  # x is a variable storing the value 5\n",
        "    name = \"Alice\"  # name is a variable storing the string \"Alice\"\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- **Constant Convention** 📜: Constants are typically written in uppercase, but remember Python doesn't enforce immutability.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    PI = 3.14159  # PI is a constant, by convention, its value shouldn't be changed\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- Variables can store different types of data: integers, floats, strings, lists, etc.\n",
        "- Constants are typically used for values that remain the same throughout the program (e.g., mathematical constants, configuration settings).\n",
        "- **Reassigning Variables** 🔄: You can change the value of a variable at any time by reassigning it.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    age = 30  # age is 30\n",
        "    age = 31  # Now age is updated to 31\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: \n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Assigning values to variables\n",
        "radius = 10  # radius is a variable holding an integer\n",
        "area = 3.14159 * radius ** 2  # Calculate the area using the radius variable\n",
        "\n",
        "# Assigning a constant value\n",
        "PI = 3.14159  # PI is a constant\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reassigning the variable value\n",
        "radius = 15  # Now radius is updated to 15\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Gotcha ⚠️:\n",
        "- **Python does not enforce constant values** 🚫, meaning a constant value can still be changed. This is purely a convention used to indicate that the value should not be modified.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    PI = 3.14159\n",
        "    PI = 3.14  # This would be incorrect by convention, even though it's allowed by Python\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "- In Python, **variables** are **dynamically typed** 🔄—their data type is determined by the value they are assigned to at runtime, and it can change during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",

        "- **Variables** are flexible 🛠️ and hold data that can change over time.\n",
        "- **Constants** 🔐 are used for fixed values that ideally shouldn’t be changed once set, and are denoted by using uppercase letters by convention.\n",
